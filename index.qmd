## **About Me**
  
I am a socially-driven entrepreneur passionate about conducting business with purpose and impact. My journey began with a focus on social entrepreneurship, combining profit with meaningful contributions to society. Over time, I discovered a strong interest in the finance and investment sectors, particularly in ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) investments.

This interest led me to explore stock investments, where I developed a passion for analyzing trends and making data-driven decisions. My experiences have shaped my ambition to merge entrepreneurial values with data analysis to create innovative, impactful solutions in the financial landscape.
